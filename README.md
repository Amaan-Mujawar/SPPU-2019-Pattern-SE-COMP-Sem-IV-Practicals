# SPPU-2019-Pattern-SE-COMP-Sem-IV-Practicals Repository

Welcome to the **SPPU-2019-Pattern-SE-COMP-Sem-IV-Practicals** Repository!

This repository contains the practical codes for **Semester IV** of the **SE-COMP** program under the **2019 Pattern** at **Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU)**. It includes assignments from the following laboratories:

* **Data Structures and Algorithms Laboratory (DSAL)**
* **Microprocessor Laboratory (MPL)**

---

## About This Repository

These practicals have been implemented using the following technologies:

* **DSAL** practicals are implemented in **C++**, following the official syllabus guidelines.
* **MPL** practicals are written in **NASM (Netwide Assembler)**, which is widely used for low-level assembly programming.

While you can use the code as a reference, it is highly recommended to understand, experiment, and modify the code to strengthen your grasp of the concepts.

A **PDF of the syllabus** and relevant documentation may also be included for additional guidance.

## Deployment

### Running the Practical Codes

To successfully compile and execute the practical codes in this repository, ensure that you have the required development environments set up for each subject.

#### For DSAL (C++):

* Install **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** or any standard **C++ compiler**.
* Use an IDE such as **Code::Blocks**, **Dev-C++**, **Visual Studio**, or **VS Code** with **MinGW**.

**Installation Links:**

* [GCC Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
* [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)
* [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

#### For MPL (NASM):

* Install **NASM (Netwide Assembler)** to compile and run assembly programs.
* You can also use an emulator like **DosBox** or a compatible IDE such as **EMU8086** for testing 8086 assembly programs.

**Installation Links:**

* [NASM Official Page](https://www.nasm.us/)
* [EMU8086 Download](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.software.informer.com/)

## General Notes

* Ensure all compilers and interpreters are correctly installed and configured in your system's environment.
* For IDE-based setups, refer to their official documentation.
* If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting guides linked above.
